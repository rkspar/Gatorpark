                            <hr class="colored">
                            <p><b>The Everglades National Park is a unique wetland ecosystem in southern Florida. Formed over thousands of years from the overflow of heavy rainfall into Lake Okeechobee, the Everglades extend southwest from Lake Okeechobee to the shores of the Florida Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. Its 5,000 square miles of slow flowing water support grasslands, thick forests and diverse groups of animal, marine and bird life.</p><p>Often referred to as the "River of Grass," the swampy Everglades create endless prairies of sawgrass that rise 3 to 10 feet above the surface of the water. The sawgrass is often so dense that travel is possible only through natural water passages. The lush vegetation of the Everglades also includes mangrove, cypress, palms, pines and hardwood hammocks, or small islands. What many do not know is that the water is actually quite shallow in most places—so much so that you can stand in it! Don’t be alarmed if our guides take a quick dip during your airboat tour.</p><p>The Everglades are known for rich bird life, particularly large wading birds, such as the roseate spoonbill, great blue heron and a variety of egrets. Marine life includes alligators, of course, as well as American crocodiles, soft shelled turtles and fish such as red teriera, large mouth bass, redfish, and catfish. Other wildlife in the Everglades National Park includes deer, the endangered Florida panther and over 28 different snakes, more than a few of which are venomous.</p><p>Ready to start your Everglades adventure?

                            <b><p>The Everglades has been inhabited by native people for thousands of years. During much of the 19th century, the marsh was a hiding place for the Seminole Indians during their conflicts with the government, who wanted to displace them to Oklahoma.</p><p>Seminole Indian history began with bands of Lower Creek Indians from British-ruled southern Georgia. After entering into conflicts with Europeans and Upper Creek tribes in the mid-1700s, the Seminole Indians migrated to northern and central Florida. They were joined by other groups of Indians from Alabama and Southern Carolina, such as the Miccosukee Indians. At that time Florida was ruled by Spain, and so the Indians soon became collectively known as Seminole, a name derived from the Spanish word “cimmarones,” meaning wild people or runaways.</p><p>In the early 1800s, American troops entered the area. In order to free new land for white settlers, the US government authorized the raiding of Seminole Indian villages with the intent of displacing the Indians and re-enslaving Black fugitives who were harbored by the Seminoles.</p>

The few hundred Seminole Indians who managed to escape capture moved south and hid in the Everglades. Today, just over 2,000 Seminoles live on six reservations in Florida and are the primary residents of the Everglades.</p><p>Learn more about the history of the Seminole Indians on an Everglades airboat tour.</p><p>Between 1817 and 1858, the United States waged three Seminole Wars, nearly extinguishing the Indians and shipping survivors to Oklahoma.

                            <hr class="colored">
                            <p><b>Miccosukee Indians were also originally part of the Lower Creek Indians that inhabited Alabama and Georgia. They settled in Florida around 1715 and lived by hunting, fishing and growing crops, especially corn. The Miccosukees were also targeted by the US Government for relocation to Oklahoma during the three Seminole Wars between 1817 and 1858. Only about 50 Miccosukee Indians managed to avoid capture by hiding in the Everglades.</p><p>At first, the Miccosukee Indians were self-reliant, trading fish, game, and alligator skin for necessities such as food, clothing, guns and ammunition. However, their independence was compromised when the government began draining the Everglades and building canals for agricultural purposes in the early 1900s. This greatly reduced the fish and game populations that were the basis for the Miccosukee economy. At the same time, Miami became a major metropolitan area. In 1928, the Tamiami Trail was began providing non-Indians access to the abundant fish and game previously reserved for the Miccosukees.</p><p>In 1947, The US Department of the Interior declared that the majority of the land pertaining to Miccosukee Indian ancestral land was to become part of the Everglades National Park. Consequently, the Miccosukees were thrown into modern living and forced to create an economy that provided for commerce and education. Nevertheless, the Miccosukees managed to retain their culture by keeping their clans, language and ways.</p><p>To this day, some still prefer to live in chickees, the traditional Indian swamp dwelling. The basis for the Miccosukee economy now is tourism and gambling, which supports the approximate 550 Miccosukee Indians that live in the Everglades.</p><p>Want to know more?

                            <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
                            <hr class="colored">
                            <p><b>Did you know that the Everglades National Park is the only ecosystem in the world where alligators and crocodiles co-exist side by side? Although alligators only thrive in fresh water because they can't digest salt, crocodiles can live in both fresh and salt water. The Everglades is unique because fresh water in the Florida Bay meets the salt water of the Gulf of Mexico, creating a perfect ecosystem for both animals to live together.</p><p>Wanna know more? Here are some other interesting facts about gators:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>There are over 200,000 alligators in the Everglades—but over 1.5 million in the state of Florida!</li>
                                <li>The coastal plains of the southeastern United States are home to most gators, who live in both natural and man-made freshwater lakes, ponds, rivers, and wetland areas.</li>
                                <li>Alligators do not eat human beings! However, they will protect and defend themselves, attacking humans if they get too close or endanger their young.</li><li>Gators are territorial and frequently get into fights defending their space. As a result, you'll often see alligators that are scarred or missing a tail, leg or eye from a fight.
                                </li><li>As solitary reptiles, you'll rarely see alligators in groups except during the spring mating season. They lay 30-40 eggs which incubate for approximately 60-65 days and produce hatchlings 8-10 inches long.
                                </li><li>A whopping 68 percent of an alligator is pure muscle. Male alligators can grow up to 12 feet and weigh 400-500 pounds, while female alligators usually grow to 8-9 feet.
                                </li><li>The jaws of a gator have over 1,000 pounds of closing pressure. Yikes!
                                </li><li>Each alligator has approximately 80 teeth at any time. When they wear down or are lost in battle, they are replaced with new teeth. An alligator can go through 2,000 to 3,000 teeth in a lifetime!
                                </li><li>Gators live approximately 30-35 years in the wild, and can live past 50 years in captivity.
                                </li><li>The main diet of a gator consists primarily of fish, but they will also feed on turtles, mammals, snakes and birds.
                                </li><li>Often you'll see only the gator's head in the water, not its body. This allows them to more easily strike their prey, such as fish, without being detected.
                                </li><li>Alligators regulate their temperatures by moving out of the sun and into the shade, where they rest with their mouths open to release stored heat. They also cool off by going to the water.
                                </li><li>Because of legal protection, alligators are no longer endangered. They are, however, still classified as threatened to insure their continued protection and that of the endangered American crocodile.
